description: How to use the Apollo Client directly, without a view integration.
---

Most of the time, when you use the Apollo Client, you'll do it through one of the view layer integrations. But sometimes, you just want to fetch some data directly and use it in your application logic, or your preferred view technology doesn't have an integration package.

<h2 id="gql">gql template literals</h2>

When using Apollo Client, you usually write your queries using multiline template literals. These literals need to be tagged with the `gql` tag, like this:

```js
const query = gql`
  {
    user(id: 5) {
      username
    }
  }
`
```

The `gql` tag is a function under the hood, therefore it must be imported wherever it is used:

```js
import gql from 'apollo-client/gql';

const query = gql`...`;
```

Alternatively, if you prefer *not* to import the `gql` tag each time you use it, you can register it as a global:

```js
// In a browser
import { registerGqlTag } from 'apollo-client/gql';
window['gql'] = gql;

// In node.js
import { registerGqlTag } from 'apollo-client/gql';
global['gql'] = gql;

// Now, in any part of your app you can use the gql tag
const query = gql`...`;
```

**Note:** ES6 imports are hoisted, which may mean that client code using the `gql` tag gets evaluated before the registration of the global. To avoid race conditions, it's best to just import the tag into each file that uses it.

This template literal tag serves two functions:

1. It parses the query string.
2. It tells developer tools like `eslint-plugin-graphql` which strings in your app are GraphQL queries, so that they can be treated specially.

We hope to soon release a build tool you can run on your queries when deploying to production so that you can avoid the overhead of loading the GraphQL parser at runtime, much like Relay does with `Relay.QL`.

<h2 id="queries">Queries</h2>

The primary function of the Apollo Client is running GraphQL queries to retrieve data from the server. There are two ways to get data: running a query once and getting a single result, and running a query then watching the result via a callback.

<h3 id="query-vs-watchquery">`query` vs. `watchQuery`</h3>

If you want to fetch some data to perform a one-time operation, then `query` is the right way to go. If you are using the query result to render some UI, it's advantageous to use `watchQuery`, since that will automatically update whenever any of the following things happen:

1. A different query or mutation updates the data in the store
2. A mutation performs an optimistic update
3. Data is re-fetched because of a reactive update

This means that using `watchQuery` will keep your UI consistent, so that every query being displayed on the screen shows the exact same data for the same objects.

Currently `watchQuery` allows reactivity via the optional `pollingInterval` argument. In the future, `watchQuery` will also have more options for reactivity, like connecting to a source of invalidations for reactive re-fetching, or accepting pushed data from the server for low-latency updates. Using it now will allow you to easily switch those options on when they become available.

<h3 id="forceFetch">query diffing and forceFetch</h3>

The Apollo Client doesn't just directly send your GraphQL queries to the server. It does a lot of pre-and-post processing of the data. One of the main things it does is _query diffing_, which means comparing a query you're about to fetch with the data the client fetched previously, and sending a new query that fetches only the necessary data.

For example, let's say you do two queries, one after the other:

```
// First query fetched
{
  todoList(id: 5) {
    title
    createdAt
    tasks {
      name
      completed
    }
  }
}

// Second query, after the user clicks a button
{
  todoList(id: 5) {
    title
    createdAt
    tasks {
      name
      completed
    }
  }
  user(id: 8) {
    name
    username
  }
}
```

The Apollo Client is smart enough to realize that it already has the `todoList` data for the second query, and sends only the `user` part:

```
// Actual second query sent
{
  user(id: 8) {
    name
    username
  }
}
```

You can take advantage of this feature to reduce the amount of data your app is loading, without putting in any extra work. For example, if someone navigates to a different page of your app, then comes back immediately, if you try to load the same query again the Apollo Client will just use the existing data. This is the default behavior.

We are always going to be improving the efficiency of the query diffing algorithm. Right now, it just does basic operations, but in the future it will be able to fetch single missing objects, and diff deeply nested queries. Follow along on the GitHub repository to find out when these features are coming.

<h4 id="forceFetch">Using forceFetch</h4>

Of course, you don't always want to use the existing data in the store - sometimes you want to get the new data directly from the server even though you already have it on the client. In this case, you should pass the `forceFetch` option to `query` or `watchQuery`, as documented below.

<h3 id="query" title="ApolloClient#query">ApolloClient#query(options)</h3>

Run a GraphQL query and return a promise that resolves to a `GraphQLResult`.

- `query: string` A GraphQL query string to fetch.
- `variables: Object` The variables to pass along with the query.
- `forceFetch: boolean` (Optional, default is `false`) If true, send the query to the server directly without any pre-processing. If false, check if we have some of the data for the query on the client already, and send a minimized query to the server to refetch only the objects we don't have already.

Here's how you would run a single query and get the result:

```js
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';

// Polyfill fetch into the namespace if required.
// import fetch from 'isomorphic-fetch';

const client = new ApolloClient();

client.query({
  query: gql`
    query getCategory($categoryId: Int!) {
      category(id: $categoryId) {
        name
        color
      }
    }
  `,
  variables: {
    categoryId: 5,
  },
  forceFetch: false,
}).then((graphQLResult) => {
  const { errors, data } = graphQLResult;

  if (data) {
    console.log('got data', data);
  }

  if (errors) {
    console.log('got some GraphQL execution errors', errors);
  }
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log('there was an error sending the query', error);
});
```

<h3 id="watchQuery" title="ApolloClient#watchQuery">ApolloClient#watchQuery(options)</h3>

Run a GraphQL query and return a QueryObservable that is updated as the query result in the store changes.

- `query: string` A GraphQL query string to fetch.
- `variables: Object` The variables to pass along with the query.
- `forceFetch: boolean` (Optional, default is `false`) If true, send the query to the server directly without any pre-processing. If false, check if we have some of the data for the query on the client already, and send a minimized query to the server to refetch only the objects we don't have already.
- `returnPartialData: boolean` (Optional, default is `false`) If false, wait until the query has finished the initial load from the server to return any data. If true, return any data we might happen to already have in the store immediately. If you pass true for this option, your UI should be ready to deal with the possibility that it will get a partial result at first.
- `pollInterval: number` (Optional, default is no polling). Setting a polling interval (in ms) will refetch your query from the server (forceFetch) on the interval rate provided by the key.

<h4 id="QueryObservable" title="QueryObservable">QueryObservable</h4>

This is the object you get when you call `watchQuery`. It has just one method, `subscribe`, to which you can pass a `QueryObserver` object:

- `subscribe(observer: QueryObserver)` Pass an observer object which gets called when there is new data. Returns a `QuerySubscription` object which you can use to unsubscribe or refetch.

<h4 id="QueryObserver" title="QueryObserver">interface QueryObserver</h4>

The object you pass into `QueryObservable#subscribe`. Includes optional callbacks to receive results:

- `next(result: GraphQLResult)` Called when there is a new result for the query.
- `error(error: Error)` Called when there is a network error for the query.

<h4 id="QuerySubscription" title="QuerySubscription">QuerySubscription</h4>

The object returned from `QueryObservable#subscribe`. Includes four methods:

- `refetch(variables: Object)` Refetch this query from the server. Think of it like a refresh button. This can take an object of new variables
- `unsubscribe()` Notify the client to no longer care about this query. After this is called, none of the callbacks on the observer will be fired anymore. It's very important to call this when you are done with the query, because that is what lets the client know that it can clean up the data associated with this subscription. The view integrations will do this for you.
- `stopPolling()` Stop an actively polling query.
- `startPolling(pollInterval: number)` Start polling a query

#### Code sample

All of the concepts above seem a bit complicated, but it's not hard to use in practice. Here's how you could run a query and then watch the result:

```js
const queryObservable = client.watchQuery({
  query: gql`
    query getCategory($categoryId: Int!) {
      category(id: $categoryId) {
        name
        color
      }
    }
  `,
  variables: {
    categoryId: 5,
  },
  forceFetch: false,
  returnPartialData: true,
  pollInterval: 50,
});

const subscription = queryObservable.subscribe({
  next: (graphQLResult) => {
    const { errors, data } = graphQLResult;

    if (data) {
      console.log('got data', data);
    }

    if (errors) {
      console.log('got some GraphQL execution errors', errors);
    }
  },
  error: (error) => {
    console.log('there was an error sending the query', error);
  }
});

// Refetch the query if we want an updated result
subscription.refetch();

// Stop polling this query
subscription.stopPolling();

// Start polling this query
subscription.startPolling(100);

// Call when we're done watching this query
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

## Mutations

In addition to fetching data using queries, the Apollo Client also handles GraphQL mutations. Current support for mutations is relatively basic, just letting you send a mutation and then incorporate the result into the store.

<h3 id="mutate" title="ApolloClient#mutate">ApolloClient#mutate(options)</h3>

Send a mutation to the server and get the result. The result is also incorporated into the store, updating any queries registered with `watchQuery` that are interested in the changed objects. Returns a promise that resolves to a GraphQLResult.

- `mutation: string` The mutation to send to the server.
- `variables: Object` The variables to send along with the mutation.

Here's how you would call a mutation and pass in arguments via variables:

```js
import ApolloClient from 'apollo-client';

const client = new ApolloClient();

client.mutate({
  mutation: gql`
    mutation postReply(
      $token: String!
      $topic_id: ID!
      $category_id: ID!
      $raw: String!
    ) {
      createPost(
        token: $token
        topic_id: $topic_id
        category: $category_id
        raw: $raw
      ) {
        id
        cooked
      }
    }
  `,
  variables: {
    token: 'asdf',
    topic_id: '123',
    category_id: '456',
    raw: 'This is the post text.',
  }
}).then((graphQLResult) => {
  const { errors, data } = graphQLResult;

  if (data) {
    console.log('got data', data);
  }

  if (errors) {
    console.log('got some GraphQL execution errors', errors);
  }
}).catch((error) => {
  console.log('there was an error sending the query', error);
});
```

Right now, this is a bit verbose because you have to list the names of the variables three times, but we hope to improve this in the future.

<h3 id="fetch-polyfill" title="FetchPolyfill">Fetch Polyfill</h3>

Apollo uses [fetch](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) behind the scenes to make HTTP requests. Be aware that many browser versions now support the `window.fetch` function natively (check [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch)), but Node, for example, doesn't (as of v6).

Where it is not supported, you can use one of several popular polyfills, including [whatwg-fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch), [node-fetch](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) or [isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch).
